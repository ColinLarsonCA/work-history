# Core Developer / CTO
## Sep 2018 to May 2020
Near the end of 2018 I was offered the opportunity to work for Saskatoon based startup Brand X Technologies (BXT) as what was dubbed the Core Developer, essentially "code all the things". Brand X Technologies was building a general purpose monitoring and controlling IoT platform. I was taking over a firmware code base built by a handful of engineers and students as well as adding on to our cloud Go backend and supporting our React frontend with one other developer. Contrasting my time at SED and Vendasta, my time at BXT was working with a couple of developers, engineers, and business people at most.

The primary reason why I ended up at BXT was because I had not yet had the opportunity to work on firmware. At BXT I was the primary maintainer of the C++ firmware that ran our devices and needed to learn a lot about the limitations of the SM32 chip and electrical engineering concepts that I had never encountered before. Over time I abstracted away a lot of the more confusing aspects of sensor and control messaging to the point where new ones could be integrated with minimal code. They already had the start of a protobuf schema for messaging between the devices and server when I had got there. Over time I built this up to also include the frontend and have changes to the protobuf messages automatically compiled for all aspects of the stack. I would also integrate our protobuf messaging into the firmware and use it to define the schema of the device storage (EEPROM).

At BXT I was also given the freedom to shape parts of my role and the company how I saw fit. I took some of my learnings from Vendasta and SED and applied them to BXT, introducing sprints, retrospectives, and a kanban style of task management. When necessary I held 1-on-1s with the various team members to understand how they were doing day to day and see where improvements could be made, though it was not explicitly one of my responsibilities. I made it my job to do whatever I thought needed to be done to make our R&D efforts a success. Later I would be given the title of Chief Technology Officer (CTO), though I did not have a large team to oversee.

My time at BXT is marked by a blinding number of integrations with other technologies to bolster our product offering. I lead integrations with Google Cloud Geolocation for tracking the location of our devices whether they were wifi or cellular, Mapbox for rendering a map of devices for our customers, Twilio and SendGrid for device notifications, Stripe for billing our customers, and Datadog for monitoring our cloud infrastructure. I took a number of my Vendasta learnings about SRE and applied them to the BXT stack so we could monitor how many devices were live, how often they were messaging, how their sensors were behaving, and various other useful metrics.

As a result of all our efforts we found success in the agriculture automation space. We deployed hundreds of cellular connected devices to farms across western Canada as a whitelabeled smart grain drying product. We worked on a number of prototype devices for horticulture automation, controlling everything from the air exchanger, to the water pumps, to the air curtain. Prior to that I had to solve a number of hard problems like over-the-air updates, firmware version control, maintaining a strong connection, error reporting, and message size to reduce cellular data costs.

We also devoted some effort to figuring out a web security product that would use best-in-class web scanning technologies and crawlers to generate a full report of how secure any website was. Using that data we generated a web security graph using Neo4J. I acted as a developer consultant and lead for that project, advising on how best to integrate the various technologies and stepping in to integrate it as product offering in the larger BXT platform.

The team at Brand X Technologies introduced me to the startup scene and tested my capabilities as a full stack developer, from the firmware to the frontend. I learned a lot more about electrical engineering than I ever thought I would. At the advent of COVID-19 in 2020 I had to make the call at BXT to switch us to full remote operation which thankfully my career had prepared me for somewhat. We were able to continue like that for a time but I would eventually have to cease development, though the stack is still running smoothly without intervention at time of writing due to the team's care and attention.

After a short break to recharge and work on this website I was re-hired as a developer at [Vendasta](2020-07-vendasta).
