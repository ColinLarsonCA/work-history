# IT Support (May 2012 to Aug 2012)
During the summer of my third year of University I worked as IT Support at the National Hydrology Research Center at Innovation Place in Saskatoon, SK. This was a typical tech desk role where I provided technical support to the variety of employees at the Center - be it an issue with their computer, printer, the network storage, etc. Despite the small size of the IT team at the time, myself and the IT manager, I had the opportunity to be a part of the larger team at the Center and meet a variety of people and help make their jobs easier.

Here I familiarized myself with the nuances of communicating effectively within a field that I maybe don't understand all that well to understand the problem and apply a technical solution. Though I did not work in a programming capacity I did have the opportunity to speak with some of the people that wrote or maintained the programs used at the Center for research and debug issues with those programs while handling support tickets. I was also shown the programming language R by one of the scientists, which was quite the departure from the Java and C++ I was writing at school.

My time at NHRC was short but in that brief time I was able to improve my communication and debugging skills, and gain some empathy for technology users that just want things to work well. After that summer I went back to school and finished my degree before being hired at SED Systems, just across the street from NHRC.
