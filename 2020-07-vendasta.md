# Senior Software Developer
## Jul 2020 to Apr 2022

After my short break to recharge I was rehired at Vendasta and soon promoted to Senior Software Developer. On my return I immediately started work on their new product Meeting Scheduler for scheduling all sorts of meeting internally, for our partners, and the customers that they sold to. Since we were still in the middle of the pandemic I got to really experience the remote work life and grew to love it. Mid way through my second round at Vendasta they proposed a new product to my team, Proposal Builder, and that's what I worked on for the rest of my time there. An even more brand new product to fill another gap in the new always online, always remote marketplace. A tool to build beautiful and dynamic product proposals for delivery to end consumers to explain what products and services would best serve their needs. This product marked my return to React from Angular so that we could build the core editor experience with https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate as our basis. Later on I was given the opportunity to represent Vendasta as a technical interviewer for the folks at https://calendarhero.com/ who Vendasta ended up acquiring (https://www.vendasta.com/newsroom/vendasta-acquires-calendarhero/).

This second term at Vendasta was similar in ways to my previous term there but really allowed me to lean into developing technical excellence and building delightful greenfield products. Depending on what was needed I represented my team as a technical expert, other times presenting our new products to the whole company and building hype around them, and sometimes stepping outside the comfort of the day to day work to represent the company externally.

Early in 2022 I was approached by [7shifts](2022-05-7shifts) to join their engineering team and help accelerate their product growth, which is where I ended up next!
