# Software Developer / Team Lead
## Jan 2017 to Aug 2018
At the start of 2017 I received an offer to join the team at Vendasta as a "level 10" software developer. The term has since changed but the role was essentially a developer on a small agile team working on a single product with a team lead to oversee them and a product manager to navigate the business side. After completing a bit of training dubbed Vendasta University where I was shown the ins and outs of their product offering I was handed over to a team called the Tunnel Snakes (named after the gang from [Fallout](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tunnel_Snakes)), the team that developed their in-house billing solution.

Vendasta was a company working on A LOT of online reputation, listing, and other such products. If it had to do with digital solutions that might aid a small or medium business (SMB) then Vendasta had a product offering to cover that need. Tying all of that together was their larger platform where the business owner could access all of their solutions and see at a high level how their brand was doing and dig down into deeper insights. With that all in perspective I was tasked with helping to develop their billing infrastructure to better serve how they billed their customers for their large product offering.

So I went to work under the tutelage of my team lead and the team around me to work on the billing project. At the time this was a Google AppEngine hosted Python backend with a MySQL database serving an API. We also covered all aspects of the billing UI/UX which was built into many parts of the platform frontend using the Angular framework. Eventually our billing stack saw the addition of Go as a backend language, and Typescript for parts of the frontend, both of which quickly topped the list of my favourite languages. I consider myself lucky to have joined Vendasta at a time where they were beginning to adopt new languages as it gave me a lot of confidence when it comes to picking up new technologies and integrating them into an older system.

Through Vendasta I was introduced to the world of cloud infrastructure, specifically Google Cloud, and the concept of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). Here I learned a lot about technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. I was introduced to concepts like service-level objectives, API uptime, and autoscaling. After learning as much as I could about the full Vendasta stack I was given the opportunity to work as the SRE for the billing project where I would have a weekly conversation with the other teams' SREs about maintaining our uptime. Those conversations would also end with us discovering some way of improving or maintaining our uptime and we would each go back to our respective projects to make those changes and teach our teams what we had learned.

This was also my introduction to an agile development style where sprints, 1-on-1s, pairing, mobbing, and standups were all common practice. Through this I was able to learn not just the benefit of meeting with customers to understand their needs but also my own teammates. With great, engaged people all around to encourage me I was given the confidence to just "ship it". It was at Vendasta that I really hit my stride to be a confident developer and make or propose changes in projects even outside my own when I saw the need. Once I had built up that confidence I positioned myself as a mentor on my team and was later given the opportunity to become the Team Lead of the Tunnel Snakes, later renamed to the Psycho Billers, when my Team Lead became an Engineering Manager.

As a Team Lead at Vendasta my responsibilities involved both developing our product and maintaining a conversation with other development teams and finance team together with the billing product manager. I also had the unique opportunity of running my team as part remote as gradually our team members changed. Through 1-on-1s with my team I began to learn more and more about remote management through products like Trello, virtual whiteboards, calls over Slack, and always on conferencing through Google hangouts. It was a unique challenge for me but one that has shaped my preferences as a developer likely forever. I continued as a Team Lead at Vendasta for the rest of my time there where I helped to flesh out and develop flexible pricing plans, different ways of charging for our products, integrations with payment processors, and sitting in with other teams to help them integrate their products into the billing infrastructure.

My time at Vendasta was invaluable to develop my confidence as a developer and leader, and truly shaped what I now consider to be best practices for both local and remote development. I would then take what I learned at Vendasta to build a cloud hosted IoT platform from bare foundations at the Saskatoon based startup [Brand X Technologies](2018-09-bxt).
