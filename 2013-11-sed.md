# Software Developer / Junior Software Lead
## Nov 2013 to Jan 2017

After graduating from the University of Saskatchewan in the fall of 2013 I applied at SED Systems, just across the street from NHRC where I had previously worked a co-op, where I was hired as an Entry Level Software Developer. I completed my initial few weeks of training doing some simple tasks in one of their Java Swing projects before moving over to their SiriusXM Satellite Radio team. At the time the team was about 50-50 senior developers and newer developers like myself so I had plenty of opportunity to be mentored by a variety of developers and learn all aspects of the project.

I spent my entire time at SED Systems on the SiriusXM team where I had the opportunity to work on many aspects of the satellite uplink system. Throughout my time there I had the opportunity to work closely with most of the senior developers and systems engineers and got a good feel for how the initial ask from SiriusXM turned into a scope of work, went through the development pipeline, and was then exhaustively tested through automation and manual effort by the systems engineers. My development tasks spanned the various interconnected projects and the languages and technologies we used. I gained experience working in Java (client and server), C++ (server), Bash (setup scripts), and SQL.

Over time I was also given the chance to work closely with and later maintain our on-premises test environments and later perform some production deployments. I didn't realize it at the time, but I had discovered a small interest in site reliability engineering (SRE). This role later expanded to speccing servers for our test environments, doing the research for how much it would cost, requesting the hardware, and managing the assembly of the server racks.

At some point in my time at SED I was given the role Junior Software Lead, working under the Senior Software Lead, and Project Manager of the SiriusXM team. At that point my day to day turned into a lot more management where I attended meetings directly with SiriusXM and given the responsibility to allocate team members to some of our ongoing projects. Through this I was able to learn a lot about managing mine and other people's time and making sure that all aspects of a project were going according to plan through a kanban approach. I became an occasional mentor to some of the new developers that were coming in and had to become an expert at balancing my ever growing list of responsibilities, and figuring out when it was time to delegate. Given my inexperience at the time, I don't know if I ever got very good at it at SED.

My time at SED Systems was one where I developed so many skills I never even considered, and varied in the types of roles I got to fill and deal with day to day. I learned lots about development, testing, hardware, people and time management, interacting directly with the customer, and managing expectations. Many of these skills I found invaluable when I left SED Systems to pursue an opportunity to work in my first cloud hosted environment at [Vendasta](history/2017-01-vendasta).
